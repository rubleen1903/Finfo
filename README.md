# Finfo
Our website will help individuals to gain knowledge in the field of personal finance as well as personal investments. 
Our platform will help bring like minded people of different level of expertise to come together, ask and answer questions regarding different subjects like taxation and tax returns, loans and investments. 


#Problem Solved 
In the current pandemic situation financial management became a thing of  utmost importance. 
The great lockdown caused many to start work from home and this led to an increase in the percentage of popular interest in finance, financial independence and investment.
Feb 2020 saw a steep rise of at least 70% for the first time investors investing in markets.
This new influx of  young investors although is good from the new generation but the lack of experience and knowledge can lead them to lose their money.

#Implementation and Design
Our platform is a user friendly platform with easy to navigate site map.
We not only provide platform for discussion and asking questions but also provide people with experience a platform to help share their knowledge to the masses.
Our website will also provide section where people can share resources they think can be helpful for others. A structured section that will list the subject as well as subject matter expert and resources regarding the subject. 

#Impact
With the help of our platform we want to help new up coming generation to be able to become financially literate and learn how to manage money. 
Our platform aims to create a community of people who are able to help others and learn the basic financial knowledge which will help them go forward in life.
